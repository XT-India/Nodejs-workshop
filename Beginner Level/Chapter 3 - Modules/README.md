<h3>Modules</h3>
----------------------------------
Node has a simple module loading system.
In Node, files and modules are in one-to-one correspondence. As an example, foo.js loads the module circle.js in the same directory.

Note : Variables local to the module will be private, as though the module was wrapped in a function. In this example, the variable PI is private to circle.js
