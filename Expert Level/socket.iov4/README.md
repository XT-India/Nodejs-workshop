Socket.io - Binding the front and back-end together with Node.js and Canvas - Meetup October '13
================================================================================================

**Socket.IO aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms.**

Although that's a steep claim, Socket.io makes good on their promise with a deep browser pool (IE 5.5+, Safari 3+, Chrome 4+, Firefox 3+) and a myriad of support transports, the primary being HTML5's websockets. With websockets, we can make live-chats, realtime collaboration applications, and multi-player games possible.

For this presentation, we'll be looking at the steps needed to make a simple 2-player game (that everyone should recognize) using Socket.io to handle our data.  It'll feature simple match making and (obviously) realtime play. Node.js will be handling our backend data and the visuals will be handled with HTML5's Canvas.

That's right ladies and gentlemen, from the front to the back, everything is pure JavaScript goodness*!

Your presenter will be Ben Solum

_*with just a tiny bit of HTML and CSS... :P_
